            <h3>Malayan tiger</h3>
            The Malayan tiger has been considered an critically endangered animal since 2015. As of year 2022, it is
            determined that there is less than 150 individuals and is continuing
            to reduce in numbers due to several reasons. The 2 main reasons are given as loss of habitat and illegal
            poaching. Due to development projects, the tiger's habitat, natural forest in
            Peninsula Malaysia has decrease in size rapidly. Besides that, tiger body parts are also considered a rare
            traditional medicine in certain cultures, therefore it is being threatened
            by poachers ever since. Furthermore, tiger skins can be manufactured into expensive cosmetics which are very
            popular in the rich. In short, we need to provide as much aid to the Malayan
            tigers as we can to prevent its extinction.

            <h3>Bornean orangutans</h3>
            The Bornean Orangutans has been in a critically endangered status due to its rapid population decrease by
            60% since the 1950s. Orangutans plays an important roles in maintaining the biodiversity
            of the jungle as they help in seed dispersing which keeps the jungle healthy. The current main threat
            towards the orangutans is illegal logging. Due to agriculture needs, large area of lands
            are needed. Therefore, some unresponsible companies burn down forests to save costs for logging and caused
            many orangutans to burn alive in forest without being able to escape. Deforestation
            also causes orangutans to lose their habtat and decrease in numbers quickly. Sometimes, young orangutans are
            also hunted down to be sold for pet trading in certain places. In conclusion, we
            should help raise awareness on the importance of orangutans before its extinction.

            <h3>Sea Turtle</h3>
            The sea turtles are also a critically endangered species since its massive population decline. One of the
            turtle
            species in Malaysia, the leatherback turtle has decreased by more than 99% since 1960s.
            It has also been shown that no leatherback turtle has ever shown nesting in Malaysia since 2017. There are
            currently three main threats being faced by the sea turtles in our country. The first
            one being turtle eggs being collected for consumption and trading. This causes the turtle population unable
            to increase in numbers. The second threat is the trash in oceans. There have been
            many cases where turtles are caught in nets and unable to surface to breathe, which results in them
            drowning. There are certain cases where turtles wrongly feast on plastics and gets poisoned.
            The third threat is climate change which affects the sea ecosystem. In this scenario, we can help by working
            as a volunteer or donating to research and conservation centres which helps in monitoring
            the breeding of turtles.

            <h3>Bornean elephant</h3>
            The Bornean elephants has been classified as an endangered species with only less than 1500 individuals
            alive today. It has been determined
            that the population of Bornean elephants has decreased by a minimum of 50% over 3 generations. There are a
            few threats which are being faced by
            Bornean elephants right now. The main threat being conflict with humans. As the country continues to
            develop, lands are not only needed for agriculture,
            but also infrustructure. This causes the elephants to lose their habitats. Sometimes, elephants may need to
            travel through plantations to reach their destinations
            and this causes them to trample over the plantation. This results in conflicts between the elephants and
            humans, and in serious cases, elephnats are shot down
            by humans. Other than that, due to deforestation, food source has also been a huge problem for the Bornean
            elephants as their main food source are plants. To
            conclude, we can help by donating to conservation centers which helps in monitoring the elephant's habitat
            in order to reduce elephant-human conflict.

            Our community has been putting effort into helping Malaysa's wildlife ever since the society's creation. Our
            community has mainly
            been focusing on providing aids to Malaysia's wildlife through various methods. For example, organising
            fund-raising events to gain support
            for the conservation of various endangered species in Malaysia. Besides that, our community members are
            willing to volunteer in helping in the
            monitoring and conserving of the animals which are facing various threats caused by human beings. This can
            result in the reduction of human-animal
            conflicts. Come join us in helping our country's beautiful wildlife and help preserve it or donate to our

            <h3>Reforestaion Project</h3>
            The Reforestation Project is a project dedicated to restore and improve ecosystems in our country.
            Currently, many
            has joined in this project and provided much help. It has been a huge success with certain areas finally
            restoring to its original.
            However, there are still much more to do as the forest area in our country are still much more lesser than
            what is needed by the wildlife in
            Malaysia. Come join us in this cause or help us by donating funds for seedlings for reforestation!
